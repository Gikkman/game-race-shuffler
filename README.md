## Server Config
Server default config can be found in `server-config.base.json`.

If anything should be overwritten when running the server, create a file named `server-config.override.json` and override the values you wish to overwrite. This file will not be tracked by Git, so any secrets should be added to this file and not the config file containing defaults.
